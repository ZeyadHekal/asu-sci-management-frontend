## Analysis Process

Before responding to any request, follow these steps:

1. Request Analysis

   - Determine task type (code creation, debugging, architecture, etc.)
   - Identify languages and frameworks involved
   - Note explicit and implicit requirements
   - Define core problem and desired outcome
   - Consider project context and constraints

2. Solution Planning

   - Break down the solution into logical steps
   - Consider modularity and reusability
   - Identify necessary files and dependencies
   - Evaluate alternative approaches
   - Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementation Strategy
   - Choose appropriate design patterns
   - Consider performance implications
   - Plan for error handling and edge cases
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Verify best practices alignment

## Code Style and Structure

- Use styles in styles dir since it is comes with vristo. Apply styles in tailwind.css inside styles dir if there is already styles applied otherwise apply styles by adding classes in the component itself like normal way.
- Vristo doc: https://html.vristo.sbthemes.com/
- Use vristo components since this project built with vristo components even in figma design

### General Principles

- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability

### TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference

### State Management

- Use zustand

### Import hooks, types and validation schemas from generated folder inside src dir

- We use kubb library to generate swagger api auto so generated folder created auto by kubb
